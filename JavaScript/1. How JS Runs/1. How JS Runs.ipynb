    "## Execution Context\n",
    "Execution context is the environment where a specific poriton of code gets executed. There are two types of execution contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Global Execution Context\n",
    "2. Function Execution Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Execution Context\n",
    "Whenever we execute JavaScript code, it creates a Global Execution Context. It has two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (i) Creation Phase\n",
    "In the creation phase, two unique things get created:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A global object called **window**\n",
    "- A global variable called **this**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the creation phase, if there are any variables declared in the code then:\n",
    "- Memory gets allocated for the variables\n",
    "- A variable is intialized with a unique value called **undefined**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the creation phase, if there is any function in the code then:\n",
    "- The function is placed into the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (ii) Execution Phase \n",
    "In the exeuction phase, the code execution starts. Here, the value assignment of global variables takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand this with the help of an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "    var name = \"Ahmed\";\n",
    "    function logName(){\n",
    "        console.log(this.name);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "When we load this code in the browser, a global execution context is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Creation Phase:**\n",
    "- The global object **window** and the variable **this** get created\n",
    "- Memory is allocated for the variable `name` and the function `logName()`\n",
    "- The variable `name` gets initialized by a special value called `undefined` and the function gets placed in the memory directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execution Phase:**\n",
    "- The value `\"Ahmed\"` is assigned to the variable `name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* We have only defined the function `logName` but have not invoked it. When a function is invoked, a **function execution context** is created. Let's try to understand *Function Execution Context*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Execution Context\n",
    "When we call(invoke) a function, a Function Execution Context gets created. Suppose, we call the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "    logName();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function exection context goes through the same phases, creation and exection but with a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Function Execution Context does not create a global object `window` instead it created an object named `arguments` that contains a reference to all the arguments passed to the function. \n",
    "- Also, it is to be noted that the `window` object and the `this` variable created in the Global Execution Context are still accessible in the Function Exection Context. \n",
    "- When a function invokes another function, a new function exection context gets created for each new function call. Each of the function exection determines the scope of the variables used in the respective functions. "
